Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python (>= 3.6) installed. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

Installation
First, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
pip install transformers
Dataset Preparation
Prepare your dataset by splitting it into training and validation sets. Format the dataset appropriately for your task, which may include tokenization.

Model Loading and Fine-Tuning
Load a Pre-Trained Model
Select and load the pre-trained model along with its tokenizer. For example:

python
Copy code
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "<MODEL-NAME>"  # e.g., "EleutherAI/gpt-neo-2.7B"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
Replace <MODEL-NAME> with the model you intend to use.

Prepare Your Data
Encode your texts using the tokenizer:

python
Copy code
train_encodings = tokenizer(train_texts, truncation=True, padding=True)
val_encodings = tokenizer(val_texts, truncation=True, padding=True)
Then, prepare your dataset for training.

Fine-Tuning
Use the Hugging Face Trainer for fine-tuning:

python
Copy code
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    warmup_steps=500,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir='./logs',
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=val_dataset
)

trainer.train()
Adjust training parameters as necessary.

Generating Text or Code
Generate outputs by providing a prompt to your model:

python
Copy code
prompt = "Your prompt text here"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)

## Data Generation Process

<details>
<summary> <strong> Running the code </strong> </summary>

1. Set environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python -m generate_instruction generate_instruction_following_data` to generate the data.

</details>

We built on the data generation pipeline from [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) and made the following modifications:

- We used `text-davinci-003` to generate the instruction data instead of `davinci`.
- We wrote a new prompt (`prompt.txt`) that explicitly gave the requirement of instruction generation to `text-davinci-003`. Note: there is a slight error in the prompt we used, and future users should incorporate the edit in <https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/pull/24>
- We adopted much more aggressive batch decoding, i.e., generating 20 instructions at once, which significantly reduced the cost of data generation.
- We simplified the data generation pipeline by discarding the difference between classification and non-classification instructions.
- We only generated a single instance for each instruction, instead of 2 to 3 instances as in [1].

This produced an instruction-following dataset with 52K examples obtained at a much lower cost (less than $500).
In a preliminary study, we also find our 52K generated data to be much more diverse than the data released by [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl).
We plot the below figure (in the style of Figure 2 in the [self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) to demonstrate the diversity of our data.
The inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the instructions, and the outer circle represents the direct objects.

## Fine-tuning

We fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code.
We fine-tune LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B | LLaMA-13B |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Batch size     | 128      | 128       |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5     | 1e-5      |
| Epochs         | 3        | 5         |
| Max length     | 512      | 512       |
| Weight decay   | 0        | 0         |

To reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Below is a command that fine-tunes LLaMA-7B with our dataset on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode.
We were able to reproduce a model of similar quality as the one we hosted in our demo with the following command using **Python 3.10**.
Replace `<your_random_port>` with a port of your own, `<your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer>` with the
path to your converted checkpoint and tokenizer (following instructions in the PR), and `<your_output_dir>` with where you want to store your outputs.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
    --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \
    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 2000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \
    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'LlamaDecoderLayer' \
    --tf32 True
```

The same script also works for OPT fine-tuning. Here's an example for fine-tuning OPT-6.7B

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
    --model_name_or_path "facebook/opt-6.7b" \
    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 2000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \
    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'OPTDecoderLayer' \
    --tf32 True
```

Note the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.
To run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.

### Addressing OOM

Naively, fine-tuning a 7B model requires about 7 x 4 x 4 = 112 GB of VRAM. Commands given above enable parameter sharding, so no redundant model copy is stored on any GPU.
If you'd like to further reduce the memory footprint, here are some options:

- Turn on CPU offload for FSDP with `--fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap offload"`. This saves VRAM at the cost of longer runtime.
- In our experience, DeepSpeed stage-3 (with offload) can at times be more memory efficient than FSDP with offload. Here's an example to use DeepSpeed stage-3 with 4 GPUs with both parameter and optimizer offload:
    ```bash
    pip install deepspeed
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
        --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \
        --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
        --bf16 True \
        --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
        --num_train_epochs 3 \
        --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
        --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
        --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
        --evaluation_strategy "no" \
        --save_strategy "steps" \
        --save_steps 2000 \
        --save_total_limit 1 \
        --learning_rate 2e-5 \
        --weight_decay 0. \
        --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
        --deepspeed "./configs/default_offload_opt_param.json" \
        --tf32 True
    ```
  - The DeepSpeed library also provides some [helpful functions](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory.html) to estimate memory usage. 
- [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads. This can reduce the total memory footprint from 112GB to about 7x4=28GB. We may release our re-implemention of this in the future, but for now the [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) codebase can be a useful resource.

## Recovering Alpaca Weights

The weight diff between Alpaca-7B and LLaMA-7B is located [here](https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b-wdiff/tree/main).
To recover the original Alpaca-7B weights, follow these steps:
```text
1. Convert Meta's released weights into huggingface format. Follow this guide:
    https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama
2. Make sure you cloned the released weight diff into your local machine. The weight diff is located at:
    https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tree/main
3. Run this function with the correct paths. E.g.,
    python weight_diff.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir> --path_tuned <path_to_store_recovered_weights>
```

Once step 3 completes, you should have a directory with the recovered weights, from which you can load the model like the following

```python
import transformers
alpaca_model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("<path_to_store_recovered_weights>")
alpaca_tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("<path_to_store_recovered_weights>")
```
